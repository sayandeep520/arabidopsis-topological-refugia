# arabidopsis-topological-refugia
This repository introduces a"Quantum-Topo-Genetics" pipeline.It uses Topological Data Analysis (TDA) and Ricci Curvature to model the Arabidopsis landscape as a Riemannian manifold. We demonstrate that RPM1 resistance genes are locally coupled to geometric bottlenecks (P≈0.07), suggesting that habitat topology creates natural refugia for diversity.
